h1. Configuration

In your @Config.groovy@ add the following lines:

{code}
grails.plugins.daoartefacts.datasource.name = "Oracle"
grails.plugins.daoartefacts.datasource.all = ["Oracle", "Postgres"]
{code}

The first one means the actual datasource type. The second is a list with all known
types. In this case, the plugin will understand that Oracle and Postgres will, sometimes, 
reside in yours class names.
