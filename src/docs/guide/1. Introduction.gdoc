That working with database using Grails is very trivial, everybody knows. 
You just have to write some domain mappings here, change some connection configurations there, and everything works like a charm.

But, well, sometimes we have to do some additional coding around the conventions and we do need write some SQL instructions for 
certain kinds of databases. Those things commonly happen when you're working with legacy systems. 
The best approach, with no doubt, would be to map everything as domain classes, and take all Grails advantages. But it's not always possible.
